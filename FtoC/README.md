# Fahrenheit to Celsius converter

### Coding Process
I started by first binding "Fahrenheit" to a prompt that pops up and said, "What is the temperature in Fahrenheit?"

```let Fahrenheit = prompt("What is the temperature in Fahrenheit?");```

My next step was to create a variable named "Celsius," and this variable's value was determined by 

```(Fahrenheit -32) * (5/9)```

Then, I used console.log to print out the result of "Celsius," and then I also added a sentence, "Here is the same temperature, but written CORRECTLY."

```console.log(Celsius);```


```console.log("Here is the same temperature, but written CORRECTLY.");```


The logic behind this code is rather simple. It is basically assigning 2 variables, running an equation, and then printing the results in javaScript. I used the code from the codealong.js file as a reference and found it to be very helpful.
