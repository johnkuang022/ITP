# Haiku Homework 

I found a russian haiku online and referred back to the terminal commands we used in class to create an .aiff file in the documents folder. I then dragged that .aiff file into the Haiku folder and pushed it up to the remote repository. 

The poem in the recording is found on the following website:

### I repeated the terminal commands shown in class, then located the aiff file in the documents folder.

#### It took me a while to figure out how to embed the image above. I found this thread on Stack Overflow to be helpful.

#### However, I could not figure out how to scale the image since it is taking up so much space on the page.

### After many attempts, I could not get the image to display on the GitHub repository. It says the file path Haiku/haiku.png is not found in the main branch of ITP, but the .png file is definitely in the Haiku folder. 
### The image displays normally when I use the preview function in Textmate to check my work.
