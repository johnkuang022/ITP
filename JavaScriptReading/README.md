# JavaScript Reading

### Chapter 1:
1. I learned that I can use single quotes, double quotes, and even backticks to mark strings in JavaScript.
2. I knew that JavaScript is a 64-bit programming language.

### Chapter 2:
1. I learned that the prompt function gives you no control over the appearance of the dialog. Therefore, it is not used by more modern websites. 
2. All of the information in this chpater were new information to me, so there was nothing I knew before. 

### Chapter 3:
1. I learned that a function can have multiple parameters or no parameters at all.
2. This is probably the most difficult chapter so far. After reading through it once, I'm not sure I can fully grasp all the ideas introduced in this chapter. All of the informatino were new information to me. I think the flexibility of "functions" would take a lot of practice in coding for me to understand.
